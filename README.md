This project fetches earthquake data from the USGS Earthquake API and performs exploratory analysis and visualization. It focuses on earthquakes within a 150 km radius of Vancouver, BC (latitude 49.24, longitude -123.11) from 1950 to the present.

The project includes:

Data collection directly from the USGS API.

Data cleaning and preprocessing with Pandas.

Interactive spatiotemporal heatmap of earthquake events with Folium.

Trend analysis of earthquake magnitudes and frequencies over time using Seaborn/Matplotlib.
